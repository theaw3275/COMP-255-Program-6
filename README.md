# COMP-255-Program-6

Note on the data:
The data used in this project has several issues. ChatGPT4o was used to
generate the AI texts and, despite persistent prompting would not write
very long stories. So the AI generated stories are considerably shorter 
than the stories written by Austen. This is not ideal: in the shorter 
space ChatGPT4o cannot write the same variety of words as Austen. In an 
attempt to combat this somewhat, the words in the dataset were required 
to appear in at least 8 documents (the number of Austen texts), rather 
than requiring words to appear in every document (and end up with very 
few colmumns as the AI texts are short) or accept every word in every 
document (and end up with way too many columns).

The Disposition of Miss Halwell  
by an admirer of Miss Austen

CHAPTER I  
In the county of Surrey, where the hedgerows bloom as liberally as the gossip, there lived a young lady of such singular disposition that even her closest friends despaired of ever understanding her completely. Miss Margaret Halwell, only child of the widowed Mrs. Halwell of Greystone Lodge, was admired by many, understood by few, and feared by at least two eligible bachelors.

She was not beautiful in the conventional sense. Her features were fine, her complexion fair, but it was her manner—decisive, brisk, and unflinchingly candid—that marked her out from her peers. At two-and-twenty, she had already refused three suitors, edited the vicar’s sermon, and scandalized a house party by quoting Greek.

Mrs. Halwell, who had once hoped for a docile daughter, now contented herself with the knowledge that Margaret would never be bullied, compromised, or—Heaven forbid—bored.

CHAPTER II  
It was during the annual Netherfield Assembly that Margaret met Mr. Edwin Trelawney, a man whose indifference to society’s opinions was exceeded only by his punctuality. He had inherited a small estate, a library of considerable value, and a reputation for disagreeableness that he neither denied nor contradicted.

They were introduced by Mrs. Shortridge, who whispered to Margaret, “Do not be alarmed, my dear—he only bites if provoked.”

Margaret, who had no fear of teeth or temper, extended her hand. Mr. Trelawney bowed.

“You appear remarkably at ease,” he said after their first dance.

“I am seldom uneasy,” she replied.

“And yet you live in society.”

“I endure it. Much like one endures weather.”

He smiled, though not kindly. “We are alike in that.”

CHAPTER III  
Despite—or perhaps because of—their sharp exchanges, Margaret and Mr. Trelawney soon found themselves in frequent proximity. Their conversations were observed with both fascination and horror. Mrs. Halwell watched from a safe distance, torn between hope and apprehension.

“You spar as if for sport,” she told her daughter.

Margaret shrugged. “Better to be engaged in fencing than embroidery.”

To complicate matters, Mr. James Fellowes, a well-bred and insufferably polite gentleman of steady income, began to pay Margaret marked attention. He brought her violets, complimented her handwriting, and declared himself “most attracted by her firmness of character.”

She replied, “Then you must also admire granite.”

CHAPTER IV  
Matters reached a peak during a dinner at the home of Sir Geoffrey Linton. Mr. Fellowes proposed in the drawing room—while Mr. Trelawney stood by the fireplace, silent but attentive.

“I offer you a life of security, companionship, and respect,” Mr. Fellowes said.

“I appreciate your clarity,” Margaret replied. “But I do not wish to be respected by someone who misunderstands me.”

Later that evening, Mr. Trelawney approached her on the terrace.

“I do not pretend to understand you either,” he said, “but I find the effort agreeable.”

Margaret looked at him. “Is that meant to be a compliment?”

“I believe so. Though I shall not revise it.”

CHAPTER V  
Gossip now swirled in earnest. Mrs. Halwell took to writing long letters to her sister in Devon. Mr. Trelawney’s aunt in Bath sent a strongly worded note advising him to consider women with less inclination toward rhetoric.

Margaret remained unmoved. She did not chase affection, nor flee from it. But when Mr. Trelawney arrived one rainy morning with a volume of Cicero and an expression both serious and shy, she permitted herself to hope.

“I had not intended to say anything,” he began, “but I find myself increasingly disinterested in intentions.”

“A poor beginning,” she said, not unkindly.

“Then allow me to continue badly,” he replied. “Margaret, I admire your mind. I enjoy your company. I respect your sharpness and your stillness. If you could tolerate my silences and my peculiarities, I would ask you to be my wife.”

CHAPTER VI  
She did not answer at once. Instead, she closed the book he had brought, placed it carefully on the table, and looked him squarely in the eye.

“I would never marry a man I did not like,” she said. “And I do not like very many people.”

He smiled, barely. “Is that a yes?”

“It is not a no.”

CHAPTER VII  
They were engaged within the week. The county divided itself neatly into two camps: those who called it a triumph of intellect, and those who called it a dreadful mistake. Mrs. Halwell wept—not from sorrow, but from sheer exhaustion.

The wedding was modest, the vows spoken clearly, and the guests surprisingly well behaved. Mr. Trelawney kissed his bride’s hand rather than her lips, and Margaret, in her usual style, told him, “You’ll have to learn to be less ceremonial.”

CHAPTER VIII  
In their marriage, as in their courtship, there was no false sweetness. They disagreed frequently and affectionately, read in separate corners of the same room, and rarely entertained unless compelled.

Margaret continued to quote Greek. Mr. Trelawney learned to interrupt her only when absolutely necessary.

And when asked by a curious cousin what first drew her to her husband, Margaret replied, “He listens when I speak, and does not speak simply to be heard. In this world, that is almost enough.”

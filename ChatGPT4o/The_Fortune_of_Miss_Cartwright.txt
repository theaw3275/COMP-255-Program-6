The Fortune of Miss Cartwright  
by an admirer of Miss Austen

CHAPTER I  
Miss Lydia Cartwright had long been considered the most agreeable young woman in her parish, though no one could quite agree upon why. Some said it was her laughter, which rang with sincerity; others cited her excellent needlework or the way she read sermons aloud to her ailing mother with such feeling. Still others—those inclined toward worldly matters—suggested her elegance was owed to her education in Bath, or perhaps her surprising command of French.

Whatever the cause, she was admired, and the fact that she remained unmarried at seven-and-twenty was cause for curiosity rather than pity.

The Cartwrights lived in modest comfort in the village of Windmere Hollow. The household consisted of Mrs. Cartwright, a widow with delicate nerves; Miss Lydia herself; and a cousin, Mr. Simon Peverell, who, though invited for a fortnight’s visit six years prior, had never left. He occupied the upstairs room and claimed it was the view of the hedgerow that persuaded him to stay.

Their society, such as it was, comprised a few other families of good sense and moderate income, including the Gregsons of Fielding House, the stern Miss Blackwell and her invalid brother, and the Harcourts, newly arrived and possessing both fortune and the eagerness to spend it.

CHAPTER II  
The arrival of Mr. Nathaniel Harcourt at Windmere Hollow was heralded with more fanfare than was strictly warranted, but it is not every day a bachelor of three thousand pounds a year moves into one’s neighborhood. Mrs. Cartwright, who had not ventured more than two miles from the village in a decade, declared it providential. Mr. Peverell, on the other hand, muttered something about "interlopers with waistcoats too fine for country lanes."

Mr. Harcourt, it must be said, was not vain of his appearance, though he had reason to be. He was tall, brown-haired, and possessed a quiet composure that made others wish to listen even before he had spoken. He danced well, wrote letters with wit, and exhibited no discernible affectations—a rarity so profound that Miss Lydia Cartwright suspected it immediately.

At their first meeting, which occurred in the drawing room of Fielding House, he addressed her with civility but little flourish. It was this very lack of pretense that struck her. She had suffered through too many conversations with men who mistook admiration for entitlement and was accustomed to navigating their attentions with the delicacy of a milliner threading lace.

“You are fond of novels, Miss Cartwright?” he asked, after observing her glance at the shelf behind them.

“I am fond of good stories,” she replied, “but not necessarily those that presume to know the heart by chapter three.”

He smiled. “Then you must detest most of what is written.”

“I fear I do.”

CHAPTER III  
As the weeks progressed, Mr. Harcourt became a fixture in village life. He attended the assemblies, rode out with the gentlemen, and spoke with kindness to every child and farmer he encountered. Still, Lydia remained cautious. She liked his company, yes, and often replayed fragments of their conversations in her mind—but she knew better than to trust appearances alone.

Complicating matters further was Mr. James Enderby, a former suitor of Lydia’s who had once proposed and been declined with as much grace as she could muster. He had since married a woman from Devonshire, yet now returned to visit his sister—and with a new interest in Lydia that could only be described as inconvenient.

“You have not changed,” he told her during a walk. “Still too clever for your own good.”

“And you,” she replied, “still too confident for yours.”

CHAPTER IV  
Rumors began to circulate. Mrs. Cartwright, in a state of genteel excitement, entertained notions of Lydia becoming mistress of Harcourt Hall before the Michaelmas moon. Mr. Peverell, meanwhile, took to reading newspapers aloud during breakfast with pointed references to men who married in haste and repented in Hampshire.

For her part, Lydia remained watchful. She did not wish to be the object of speculation, nor the heroine of some rural romance that ended in disappointment. She admired Mr. Harcourt, yes. She respected his mind, enjoyed his company, and found herself awaiting his visits with unreasonable anticipation. But was that enough?

One evening, during a walk by the stream, he turned to her.

“I hope you will forgive the bluntness of what I wish to say, Miss Cartwright,” he began, “but I have no desire to be admired generally. I wish only to be known—particularly by you.”

She stared at him, surprised. “And do you believe yourself so easily known?”

“No,” he said, with a smile. “Which is why I hope to spend a very long time trying.”

CHAPTER V  
There was, of course, a minor scandal before the matter could resolve itself peacefully. A letter, mistakenly delivered, implied that Mr. Harcourt had once been engaged to a lady in Bath—a lady now residing in a convent. The village buzzed for days.

Lydia confronted him, not in anger, but in quiet expectation.

“It is true,” he admitted. “I was once engaged. But I was not in love, and she was not suited to the life my family required. We parted with more relief than bitterness.”

“And now?” Lydia asked.

“And now,” he said, “I know better. I want a life of understanding—not of arrangement.”

CHAPTER VI  
They were married that autumn, not with pomp, but with warmth. Lydia wore a gown of soft green and carried a sprig of rosemary. Mr. Peverell gave her away, muttering only once about the loss of a second teacup at breakfast.

In time, the Harcourts became known not for their fortune, but for their kindness. Lydia continued to read aloud—this time to children of their tenants—and Mr. Harcourt, in quieter moments, still asked her opinion before offering his own.

And so, in a village where stories bloomed like hedgerow roses and wilted just as quickly, their story endured—one of quiet affection, shared respect, and the subtle transformation of admiration into love.

THE END

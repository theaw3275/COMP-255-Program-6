The Arrangement at Ashcombe  
by an admirer of Miss Austen

CHAPTER I  
It is often said—by those with little to lose—that a prudent marriage is preferable to a passionate one. Whether Miss Eleanor Ware agreed with this sentiment was a matter of no small speculation in the village of Everfield, where the Ware family had long occupied a respectable, if not particularly enviable, position.

The Wares were neither wealthy nor titled, but they were well read, well spoken, and possessed of a sort of quiet distinction that made them welcome at every table. Mr. Ware, a retired naval captain, was of the taciturn variety, and Mrs. Ware, though fond of society, had long since resigned herself to a life of modest means and unambitious routines. Of their three daughters, Eleanor, the eldest, was generally acknowledged to be the most sensible and—according to certain matrons of excellent perception—quite possibly the prettiest, though she did not seem to notice it herself.

At six-and-twenty, Eleanor was thought dangerously close to becoming one of those women described as “accomplished, but unclaimed,” a label she bore with as much indifference as she could muster.

CHAPTER II  
The arrival of Sir Thomas Leland at Ashcombe Hall—a great, ivy-draped manor a mile beyond the Ware cottage—created the usual stir. Sir Thomas, recently returned from Italy with a sunburn and a reputation for being "entirely too rich for his own good," had inherited the estate from an uncle whose disapproval of foreign travel had not extended to foreign investments.

His return was not merely social. Rumor had it he was in search of a wife. He had three sisters already married, an elderly mother in Derbyshire who longed to see her son settled, and an estate in need of a mistress with good sense and steady hands.

Mrs. Ware, upon hearing of this, declared the matter “interesting but unlikely.” Mr. Ware muttered, “The less said about Ashcombe, the better.” Eleanor said nothing at all.

CHAPTER III  
Their first meeting was unremarkable. Sir Thomas, though gallant and handsomely turned out, spoke little and observed much. Eleanor, for her part, was polite but not enthusiastic. She had expected pomposity, perhaps even conceit. What she encountered was a kind of weary intelligence and an unexpected attentiveness to her remarks on Italian painting.

“You have been to Florence?” she asked.

“Yes,” he said, “but the landscapes did not impress me as much as the silence in the Uffizi.”

“You are the first man I’ve met who remembered the silence more than the statues.”

He smiled. “Statues are expected. Silence is not.”

CHAPTER IV  
They saw one another often over the coming weeks, though never with the sort of orchestrated intent that villagers so adore. Sir Thomas visited the local parish, attended a charity concert in the rectory garden, and walked the lanes where Eleanor frequently read poetry aloud to her youngest sister, Grace.

Gradually, Eleanor revised her opinion of him. He was not distant, only deliberate; not cold, only cautious. He had a way of listening that unnerved people into speaking more than they intended. And unlike many men of his station, he never offered compliments without merit.

But just as their acquaintance ripened into familiarity, another figure entered the scene—Miss Juliana Brand, a beauty of considerable charm and recently returned from Bath with new gowns, excellent French, and an unmistakable ambition to become Lady Leland.

CHAPTER V  
Miss Brand flattered, laughed, and displayed all the necessary symptoms of affection in Sir Thomas’s presence. Her mother, a widow of alarming energy, arranged dances, dinners, and picnics with surgical precision.

Eleanor, far from jealous, observed it all with wry detachment. If Sir Thomas wished to be won, Miss Brand had certainly mastered the art of conquest. And yet, when they danced at the harvest ball, it was Eleanor with whom Sir Thomas spoke seriously, asked questions of weight, and fell into silences that were more revealing than speech.

One evening, after a particularly pointed waltz with Miss Brand, he found Eleanor on the terrace.

“Tell me, Miss Ware,” he said, “do you believe in arranged marriages?”

“I believe in arrangements,” she said slowly, “but not all arrangements are equal.”

“And what makes one superior?”

“Mutual understanding. And some measure of fondness.”

He nodded. “And if one cannot have fondness at the start?”

“Then they must at least have honesty. The rest may come—or not.”

CHAPTER VI  
The village was soon alive with speculation. Sir Thomas was seen with both ladies—Miss Brand at concerts, Eleanor at walks. Invitations were accepted and declined with a pattern none could decode.

The mystery broke one morning when Mrs. Ware received a formal note. Sir Thomas requested permission to call upon Eleanor—with her father present. Mr. Ware, always economical with words, said only, “Well, then,” and retired to polish his boots.

When Sir Thomas arrived, his manner was composed but earnest.

“Miss Ware,” he began, “I will not pretend to be romantic. I have had my share of disillusionment. But in you I have found a rare comfort, an intellect I admire, and a kind of steadiness that makes the idea of a future something I might learn to welcome again.”

Eleanor looked at him, long and quietly. “And is that a proposal, Sir Thomas?”

“It is,” he said. “Though I welcome your amendments.”

CHAPTER VII  
She accepted—not because of his wealth or title, but because she sensed that in Sir Thomas, she would find something more enduring than admiration: partnership.

Miss Brand, though publicly gracious, privately declared that Eleanor had “no style and even less strategy.” Her mother consoled her with a journey to Margate.

The Wares celebrated simply. Mr. Ware uncorked a bottle saved since Eleanor’s christening, and Mrs. Ware began planning a wedding that would involve no more than forty guests and an excellent syllabub.

Ashcombe Hall soon echoed with more than just its master’s footsteps. Eleanor brought books, fresh ideas, and the habit of morning letters. Sir Thomas, in turn, grew visibly lighter—less like a man of fortune and more like a man of purpose.

And so it was that prudence, once thought dull, proved to be the very spark of happiness. For in their arrangement at Ashcombe, affection grew not from passion but from patience, and love—not loudly declared—was quietly, deeply understood.

THE END

The Honourable Mistake  
by an admirer of Miss Austen

CHAPTER I  
Among the gentle hills of Wiltshire lay the estate of Fairleigh, a place more admired for its symmetry than its scale. Its mistress, Lady Honoria Branscombe, had long presided over its affairs with a dignified economy of emotion. Her only daughter, Miss Isabel Branscombe, inherited not only her mother's calm brow and clear speech, but also a keen intellect and a temperament inclined toward observation rather than participation.

At one-and-twenty, Isabel was a model of composure. She had declined three proposals—each respectable—and earned the quiet amusement of her aunt, who maintained that a woman who waited for perfection would marry her own reflection. Isabel replied only that she preferred to marry a man with principles before one with poetry.

She was not without admirers, of course, but most gentlemen found her gaze too steady, her words too precise, and her silence too meaningful.

CHAPTER II  
Into this well-ordered world came Mr. Henry Alton, nephew to the Earl of Westmere and newly installed master of his uncle’s secondary estate, Wellingdon House. He was five-and-twenty, dark-eyed, and known in London for a certain dry wit that bordered on insolence. He danced well, quoted Addison, and was rumored to have written anonymous political essays with dangerous clarity.

The Branscombes first met him at a dinner at the home of Colonel and Mrs. Staunton, where the conversation drifted from hunting to legislation and finally to novels, at which point Mr. Alton remarked: “Nothing reveals a person’s character more fully than the fiction they deride.”

“Or the fiction they admire,” Isabel replied.

He turned to her, curious. “Then what do you admire, Miss Branscombe?”

“I admire restraint. Which is why I so seldom find novels worth admiring.”

He smiled. “And here I thought myself difficult to impress.”

CHAPTER III  
Thereafter, their acquaintance progressed in fits and starts. Mr. Alton was charming, certainly, but possessed a guarded quality Isabel could not quite decipher. He would speak with ease to a gathering, then withdraw the moment it dispersed. He listened more than he spoke, and when he did speak, his words carried a weight that suggested careful selection.

Isabel, far from being daunted, was intrigued. She had encountered men of elegance and men of intellect—but rarely both, and never in so unsettling a balance. Her interest, however, was tempered by caution. She had no intention of becoming the subject of an unfinished novel.

CHAPTER IV  
At the autumn hunt, Mr. Alton did what few men had dared: he criticized Isabel’s riding posture.

“You sit as though you’re challenging the saddle to a duel,” he said, offering her a hand down from her horse.

“And you speak as though wit will excuse impertinence.”

“Will it?”

“Today, perhaps,” she said, “but not tomorrow.”

The exchange was reported and misquoted with speed. By the week’s end, half the county believed them to be secretly engaged, and the other half believed them irreconcilable.

Lady Honoria, unmoved, told her daughter to either end the nonsense or proceed sensibly.

CHAPTER V  
The nonsense, however, took on a life of its own. Mr. Alton began calling at Fairleigh more frequently, always with some pretense—a book returned, a letter delivered, an inquiry about music. Isabel, though outwardly composed, began rereading his notes and rearranging her hair with unconscious care.

It was not until the Michaelmas ball that he made his intentions known—poorly.

They were walking in the garden, beneath a sky just turning silver with frost, when he said:

“I believe I may be in danger of making a mistake.”

She looked at him. “A mistake?”

“Yes. An honourable one, I hope. That is—if I were to ask you to marry me.”

“Is that a proposal, Mr. Alton?”

“It is. A hesitant, foolish, and completely sincere one.”

CHAPTER VI  
Isabel did not respond at once. She asked for time, and he gave it.

For two weeks, she considered every conversation, every glance, every silence. She consulted no one, not even her mother, but walked each morning and reread a particular passage in Addison that spoke of quiet integrity.

Then, on a rainy Thursday, she wrote a note and sent it to Wellingdon House.

“Come to tea,” it read. “I’ve decided to make a mistake.”

CHAPTER VII  
Their engagement was greeted with the usual mixture of pleasure, envy, and prophecy. Some predicted felicity, others divorce, and a few simply raised their eyebrows and adjusted their calendars.

Lady Honoria, when informed, looked up from her embroidery and said, “Well, I suppose it was inevitable. But make him read Milton aloud before the banns.”

They were married in the Fairleigh chapel, surrounded by autumn roses and skeptical relatives. Mr. Alton recited his vows with a steadiness that surprised even himself, and Isabel, now Mrs. Alton, smiled only once—but meaningfully.

CHAPTER VIII  
In the years that followed, theirs was a union marked not by spectacle but by substance. They argued about novels, walked in all seasons, and laughed in rooms no one else could understand. Mr. Alton published three essays anonymously and one openly. Isabel continued to admire restraint, but practiced affection.

And when asked how she knew he was the one, she replied, “Because he never tried to impress me. Only to understand me.”

Thus their marriage—begun as an honourable mistake—proved, in time, the wisest choice of all.

THE END

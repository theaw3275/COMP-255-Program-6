The Season at Hartwood  
by an admirer of Miss Austen

CHAPTER I  
It was widely understood in the county of Dorset that no summer was complete without at least one visit to Hartwood Park. The estate, home to the venerable—but declining—Fitzalder family, had long served as a center of social life, despite the creaking floorboards and drafty parlors that betrayed its age. Every June, a flurry of invitations arrived in the hands of gentlemen and young ladies alike, and thus began the annual season at Hartwood.

Among the many to receive such an invitation in the year this story begins was Miss Eliza Merrow, the second daughter of a gentleman who had made his fortune in shipping and subsequently lost most of it in speculation. The Merrow family, now reduced to modest circumstances, lived in a rented house on the outskirts of Penwell, and though they retained their civility and education, their drawing room curtains had faded, and their carriage...

Eliza was six-and-twenty, tall, and possessed of a frank expression that some mistook for impudence. She read widely, laughed often, and had twice refused marriage—once from a banker and once from a poet—on the grounds that neither truly saw her. She believed herself destined for a life of independence, of usefulness, and of intellectual companionship, though where such companionship might be found in Dorset remained a mystery.

CHAPTER II  
The invitation from Lady Fitzalder arrived with the usual embellishments—gold script, unnecessary ribbons, and the promise of a “musical fortnight.” Eliza, though skeptical of both music and fortnights in large houses, accepted, encouraged by her elder sister Mary, who declared the social exposure essential.

“It will do you good,” Mary said, “to be among people who do not ask about cargo rates or your opinion on parliamentary reform.”

“I quite enjoy those questions,” Eliza replied.

“And that,” Mary sighed, “is precisely the problem.”

Thus it was that Eliza arrived at Hartwood with one trunk, three books, and every intention of remaining at the edges of society.

CHAPTER III  
Hartwood Park was, as always, an intriguing contradiction. The grounds were magnificent, the ceilings impossibly high, and the chandeliers unnecessarily elaborate. But the furniture showed signs of wear, and the servants—though courteous—revealed in their glances the fatigue of a house that survived on legacy more than coin.

Among the assembled guests were the usual mix of hopeful daughters, cautious mothers, disengaged sons, and a few scattered scholars and clergymen. The most notable new arrival was Mr. Nathaniel Bellamy, nephew to Lady Fitzalder and presumed heir to the estate. He was known to have spent time in India, possessed an income of independent means, and had published, under a pseudonym, a volume of philosophical essays that had caused both admiration and outrage.

Eliza met him on her second evening at Hartwood, in the library.

“You have taken the best chair,” she observed, entering the room.

“I beg your pardon,” he replied, not rising. “I did not know it was yours.”

“It is not,” she said, “but I reserve the right to declare it so.”

“Then you must sit here,” he said, standing immediately. “And I will sit somewhere less proprietary.”

CHAPTER IV  
Their acquaintance, begun in jest, deepened with the ease of those who recognize in one another a similarity of mind. Mr. Bellamy was quiet, precise, and thoughtful—qualities Eliza greatly preferred to flattery and flamboyance. He asked questions and listened to the answers. He spoke of cities and climates and customs with neither boastfulness nor false humility.

They conversed at length in the garden, debated poetry beneath the colonnade, and even walked together in the rain, which drew no comment from either. Though not overtly romantic, there was in their exchanges a growing intimacy that did not escape the attention of the other guests.

Lady Fitzalder, watching them from a distance, said to her companion, “If he does not propose, she shall be the first woman to refuse him without being asked.”

CHAPTER V  
Complications, however, were inevitable.

Miss Georgiana Langley, a guest of beauty and ambition, made her intentions toward Mr. Bellamy very clear. Her laughter was always louder when he approached, her compliments always too precise to be accidental.

Eliza, though not jealous, was not blind.

“Miss Langley is very accomplished,” she remarked one evening.

“She is,” Mr. Bellamy said. “In the art of admiration.”

“And you dislike admiration?”

“I distrust it when it is too well rehearsed.”

Eliza tilted her head. “And what do you trust?”

“Conversation,” he said. “Especially when it does not seek agreement.”

CHAPTER VI  
Just as the fortnight reached its height, a rumor surfaced. Mr. Bellamy, it was said, had once been engaged—to a woman in Calcutta. Some said she died; others, that she married another. No one could agree, but all agreed it cast doubt upon his intentions.

Eliza, unwilling to traffic in speculation, confronted him directly.

“Were you engaged?” she asked.

“I was,” he said. “It ended—mutually and with regret. I do not speak of it often.”

“And now?”

“And now,” he said, “I find myself in conversation again, and unwilling to see it end.”

CHAPTER VII  
On the final evening of the season, beneath the pale glow of lanterns and the sound of music drifting from the salon, Mr. Bellamy found Eliza on the terrace.

“I am not an easy man,” he said. “I have too many opinions and too little patience for performance. But I admire you. Not in passing, nor for amusement, but with a wish that you would consider allowing me to speak to you every day, for the rest of our lives.”

Eliza looked at him. “You make marriage sound like a particularly engaging conversation.”

“Isn’t it?”

CHAPTER VIII  
They were married the following spring, in a small ceremony that included books instead of flowers and a vow not to interrupt one another unless absolutely necessary. Eliza brought order and laughter to Wexcombe Lodge, his estate near the coast, and Mr. Bellamy brought her silence without solitude.

Their life was not without argument, but always with respect. They published essays, adopted a dog, and received guests who knew when to leave.

When asked what first drew her to him, Eliza replied, “He argued with me. And let me win—sometimes.”
